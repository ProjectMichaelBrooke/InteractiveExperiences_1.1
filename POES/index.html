			<ul>
				<ol>POES works differently than any other tabletop game system, in a way
					that allows you to easily make your own setting.</ol>
				<br />
				<ol>It has four stats whose names you enter, a series of non-copyright
					images to used for NPCS and the ability to fill in the blanks to
					describe rooms, people and situations. As long as the setting is
					not too large, POES should be able to transform itself into any kind of
					setting you want.</ol>
			</ul>
		</span>
		<span class="age-appropriate-el">
			<ul>
				<ol>Just keep in mind that POES is meant to be used by people of many
					different ages. If you play a POES digital RPG and feel that it contains
					conent that is not appropriate for kids, please click on ‘flag as
					Adults Only’ and the entry will be.</ol>
			</ul>
		</span>
		<span class="default-stats-el">
			<ul>
				<ol>The default stats for POES are Strength, Agility, Magic and Wits, and
					all things in the game fit into one of those four categories. The names
					can be changed, but all skills learned in the game go into one of
					those categories, and if your character learns something in a stat they
					are low in, they will struggle to do it no matter how good their
					teacher was.</ol>
			</ul>
		</span>
		<span class="default-games-el">
			<ul>
				<ol>Default games give good ideas on how to rename the stats and describe
					entities, as well as containing a basic combat system. Albionus
					has Combat, Stealth, Knowledge and Erudition,for example.</ol>
			</ul>
		</span>
		<span class="skill-lists-el">
			<ul>
				<ol>Just remember when making your skill lists to ask, “What stat does that
					fit in?” and you will do fine.</ol>
